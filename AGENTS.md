## crawlbrulee ecosystem

This repository is one component of the broader crawlbrulee ecosystem of related projects.
The authoritative `crawlbrulee-ecosystem` skill — the full map of related projects,
shared-code locations, and the cross-project conventions — lives one level up, in the
maintainer's umbrella checkout:

    ../.agents/skills/crawlbrulee-ecosystem/SKILL.md

Read it from there when you need the bigger picture. It may be absent if this repository
was cloned on its own.

`.agents/` and `.claude/` are git-ignored in this repository on purpose. The skills
installer scans those folders, so anything tracked there would be installed next to the
public skills. Only `skills/` holds published skills.
